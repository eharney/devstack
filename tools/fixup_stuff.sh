# Keystone Port Reservation

# being used as ephemeral ports by the system. The default(s) are 35357 and
# 35358 which are in the Linux defined ephemeral port range (in disagreement
# with the IANA ephemeral port range). This is a workaround for bug #1253482
# where Keystone will try and bind to the port and the port will already be
# in use as an ephemeral port by another process. This places an explicit
# exception into the Kernel for the Keystone AUTH ports.
